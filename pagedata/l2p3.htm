            You have decided to specialize in gathering firewood while Friday has specialized in fishing. Your time allocation sliders
            are set to allocate all of your time to gathering firewood. Now, use the additional sliders to state how many
            logs you will trade to Friday and how many fish you want in return. You must select a trade that make both you
            and Friday better off than you were before specialization and trading. In other words, you must both receive
            more than 2000 calorie of fish and 32 logs of firewood. Both you and Fridayâ€™s consumption point is displayed
            on the PPF graphs as you adjust the trade.
