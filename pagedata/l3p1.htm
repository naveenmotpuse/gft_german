            Without trade, you and Friday could only just survive. It was not possible for either of you to produce enough to build up
            an inventory of fish or firewood. With trade however, you were able to produce more than you needed in a day.
            The extra production becomes inventory. If you can build up enough inventory, then you can achieve new goals
            like building a shelter, throwing a feast, take leisure time each day, or even exploring the island for a way
            off.
