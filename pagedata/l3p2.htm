        <p class="goaldesc" goal="shelter">
            You decide to build a shelter to protect you from the tropical rainstorms. This will require 90 logs in inventory. Trade
            with Friday until you can achieve an inventory of 90 logs. Remember that you must survive each night and Friday
            will only trade if he is made better off than he would have been on his own.
        </p>
        <p class="goaldesc" goal="feast">
            You decide to throw a feast for you and Friday. This will require 5000 calories of fish in inventory. Trade with Friday until
            you can achieve an inventory of 5000 calories of fish. Remember that you must survive each night and Friday will
            only trade if he is made better off than he would have been on his own.
        </p>
        <p class="goaldesc" goal="book">
            While walking on the beach, you find that a copy of Daniel Defoeâ€™s Robinson Crusoe has washed ashore. Having been working
            every day since you were stranded you would enjoy being able to take the time to read about someone else who
            was stranded. Reading the book will take ten hours. Produce enough without allocating all of your time so that
            you can survive by trading with Friday. Remember that you must survive each night and Friday will only trade
            if he is made better off than he would have been on his own. Any time not allocated will be used to read.
